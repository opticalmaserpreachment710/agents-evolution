# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines an automated GitHub issue management system for the Kiro repository. The system will use AWS Bedrock's Claude Sonnet 4.5 model to intelligently categorize issues, detect duplicates, and manage issue lifecycle through automated workflows.

## Glossary

- **Issue_Manager**: The automated system that processes GitHub issues (implemented in TypeScript)
- **Bedrock_Classifier**: The AWS Bedrock Claude Sonnet 4.5 model used for intelligent classification
- **Duplicate_Detector**: The component that identifies duplicate issues using AI
- **Label_Assigner**: The component that automatically assigns appropriate labels to issues
- **Stale_Issue_Handler**: The component that manages stale issues with pending-response label
- **Duplicate_Closer**: The component that closes duplicate issues after a waiting period
- **GitHub_Workflow**: The GitHub Actions workflow that orchestrates the automation

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automatic Label Assignment

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want issues to be automatically labeled when created, so that I can quickly identify and prioritize issues without manual categorization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new issue is created, THE Issue_Manager SHALL analyze the issue title and body using Bedrock_Classifier
2. WHEN the analysis is complete, THE Label_Assigner SHALL assign relevant feature/component labels from the predefined set
3. WHEN the analysis is complete, THE Label_Assigner SHALL assign relevant OS-specific labels if applicable
4. WHEN the analysis is complete, THE Label_Assigner SHALL assign relevant theme labels based on issue category
5. WHEN labels are assigned, THE Issue_Manager SHALL add the "pending-triage" label to indicate maintainer review is needed
6. WHEN label assignment fails, THE Issue_Manager SHALL log the error and continue without blocking issue creation

### Requirement 2: Duplicate Issue Detection

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want duplicate issues to be automatically identified, so that I can consolidate discussions and avoid fragmented conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new issue is created, THE Duplicate_Detector SHALL search for similar existing issues using Bedrock_Classifier
2. WHEN similar issues are found with high confidence (>80%), THE Duplicate_Detector SHALL add a comment listing the potential duplicates
3. WHEN duplicate issues are identified, THE Issue_Manager SHALL add the "duplicate" label to the new issue
4. WHEN no duplicates are found, THE Issue_Manager SHALL proceed without adding duplicate-related comments or labels
5. WHEN the duplicate detection analysis completes, THE comment SHALL include links to all identified duplicate issues with similarity scores

### Requirement 3: Automatic Duplicate Closure

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want confirmed duplicate issues to be automatically closed after a grace period, so that users have time to contest the duplicate marking while keeping the issue tracker clean.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an issue has the "duplicate" label for 3 days, THE Duplicate_Closer SHALL close the issue automatically
2. WHEN closing a duplicate issue, THE Duplicate_Closer SHALL add a comment explaining the closure reason
3. WHEN the "duplicate" label is removed before 3 days, THE Duplicate_Closer SHALL not close the issue
4. WHEN closing the issue, THE Duplicate_Closer SHALL reference the original issue in the closing comment

### Requirement 4: Stale Issue Management

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want issues awaiting user response to be automatically closed after 7 days of inactivity, so that the issue tracker remains focused on actionable items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an issue has the "pending-response" label for more than 7 days without new comments, THE Stale_Issue_Handler SHALL close the issue
2. WHEN closing a stale issue, THE Stale_Issue_Handler SHALL add a comment explaining the closure due to inactivity
3. WHEN new comments are added to an issue with "pending-response" label, THE Stale_Issue_Handler SHALL reset the 7-day timer
4. WHEN the "pending-response" label is removed, THE Stale_Issue_Handler SHALL not close the issue
5. WHEN closing the issue, THE comment SHALL inform the user they can reopen or create a new issue if needed

### Requirement 5: AWS Bedrock Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the automation to use AWS Bedrock Claude Sonnet 4 securely, so that we leverage advanced AI capabilities while maintaining security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Bedrock_Classifier SHALL use AWS Bedrock Claude Sonnet 4 model via inference profile (us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0)
2. WHEN making API calls, THE Bedrock_Classifier SHALL authenticate using AWS credentials stored in GitHub Secrets
3. WHEN API calls fail, THE Bedrock_Classifier SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
4. WHEN all retries fail, THE Issue_Manager SHALL log the error and continue without AI classification
5. THE Bedrock_Classifier SHALL include the complete label taxonomy in the prompt for accurate classification

**Note:** Inference profiles (format: `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0`) provide cross-region routing and higher throughput compared to direct model IDs.

### Requirement 6: Label Taxonomy Support

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want the system to use our predefined label taxonomy, so that issues are consistently categorized according to our organizational structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Label_Assigner SHALL support all feature/component labels: auth, autocomplete, chat, cli, extensions, hooks, ide, mcp, models, powers, specs, ssh, steering, sub-agents, terminal, ui, usability, trusted-commands, pricing, documentation, dependencies, compaction
2. THE Label_Assigner SHALL support all OS-specific labels: os: linux, os: mac, os: windows
3. THE Label_Assigner SHALL support all theme labels: theme:account, theme:agent-latency, theme:agent-quality, theme:context-limit-issue, theme:ide-performance, theme:slow-unresponsive, theme:ssh-wsl, theme:unexpected-error
4. THE Label_Assigner SHALL support all workflow labels: pending-maintainer-response, pending-response, pending-triage, duplicate, question
5. THE Label_Assigner SHALL support all special labels: Autonomous agent, Inline chat, on boarding
6. THE Label_Assigner SHALL assign multiple labels when appropriate based on issue content

### Requirement 7: Workflow Scheduling and Triggers

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want workflows to run efficiently and reliably, so that issues are processed promptly without overwhelming the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new issue is created, THE GitHub_Workflow SHALL trigger the label assignment and duplicate detection workflows immediately
2. THE Duplicate_Closer SHALL run on a daily schedule to check for issues marked as duplicate for 3+ days
3. THE Stale_Issue_Handler SHALL run on a daily schedule to check for issues with pending-response label for 7+ days
4. WHEN workflows run, THE GitHub_Workflow SHALL process issues in batches to avoid rate limits
5. WHEN GitHub API rate limits are approached, THE GitHub_Workflow SHALL pause and resume after the limit resets

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and ensure the automation runs reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any workflow step fails, THE Issue_Manager SHALL log detailed error information including issue number and error message
2. WHEN AWS Bedrock API calls fail, THE Issue_Manager SHALL log the specific error and continue processing
3. WHEN GitHub API calls fail, THE Issue_Manager SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 3 times
4. WHEN critical failures occur, THE Issue_Manager SHALL create a workflow run summary with failure details
5. THE Issue_Manager SHALL not fail the entire workflow run if individual issue processing fails
## Объяснение на пальцах
- Объясняй сложные технические вещи простым языком, как новичку.
- Выстраивай логику пошагово: что это, зачем нужно, как работает, какой результат.
- Где уместно, добавляй короткий практический пример.
- Цель ответа: новичок уже сегодня может написать качественный код и при этом понимает логику решения.
